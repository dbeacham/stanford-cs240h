# Word frequency histogram

Write a standalone program that will display (using ASCII art) a histogram of word frequencies from one or more text files (or from `stdin`).

## Specification

1. Input format.

    Input format is simply plain UTF8 encoded text. Either supplied by one or more file specified as command line arguments or as standard input if no command line arguments are specified.

2. How to break up words.

    Punctuation that isn't part of a word should be disregarded. Punctuation part of a word is significant. Words should be considered case insensitive

    ie. "Dogs don't sit on children, they sit on cats." => ["dogs", "don't", "sit", "on", "children", "the", "sit", "on", "cats"]

    ie. "Dogs DOGS Child ChIlD Hello" => [("dogs", 2), ("child", 2), ("hello", 1)]

    We aren't trying to be tricky here so we won't be giving you strange text files to parse with things like 'H!??@!LLO' in it.

3. Output format.

    Should output the words in decreasing order of frequency. Format should be as follows:

        the   ##########################
        dog   ########################
        sat   #######################
        child ##################
        a     #############
        one   ######
        ok    #

    Notice that:
    * the frequency bar for each word starts at the same column.  
    * A line should not be longer then 80 characters, so size your bars appropriately  
    * A linear scale should be used  
    * Don't worry about rounding  
    * A word with a bar length of 0 should not be printed  

4. Don't use unsafePerformIO or other such unsafe functions.
